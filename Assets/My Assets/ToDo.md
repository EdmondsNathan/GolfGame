### <p align = "center">Courses</p>
- Tours
	- Earth(standard gravity)
	- Spaceship(closed off levels, buttons to toggle artificial gravity)
	- Asteroid Belt(zero- g, lots of obstacles)
	- Moon(low gravity)
	- Jupiter(high gravity, lots of pitfalls cause gas planet)
- Solar system(goal is the sun, orbiting planets have gravity effects)

or move as far as possible)

- Zero Gravity
- Sticky
- Explosive

### <p align = "center">Hazards/Stage elements</p>
- Moving platforms
	- Sliding doors
	- Windmill
- Lasers
- Turrets(shoots projectiles that push the ball, basic projectiles, explosive)
- Breakable terrain(break after being hit)
- Space plant trap(reaches for the ball and kills if it grabs it)
- Gravity modify fields(zero gravity or extra gravity inside)

### <p align = "center">Unlocks</p>
- balls: hidden spots in courses
	- Zero gravity ball: ~~finish a zero- g course under par~~
	- Square ball: 
	- Sticky ball: ~~finish a stage under par after touching a goo field~~
	- Bouncy ball: ~~score a goal on the same shot that a ball hits a bounce pad~~
- abilities
	- Random ability: unlock all other abilities
	- Brake: have a ball in play long enough for the reset timer to activate
	- Boost: have a ball go over X meters/second
	- Reset: lose your ball to a killbox-type effect
	- Thrust: score a goal on the same shot a ball goes through a push zone
	- ~~Gravity shift: finish a stage with gravity shifting under par~~
