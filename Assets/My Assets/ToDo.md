- Rework code so that menus are not a pain to work with
	- Menus are automatically added to the opposite side when selected so that menu order doesn't matter
	- Less events to trigger for each button to transition menus to make changes easier
	- Choose ball before ability

or move as far as possible)

### <p align = "center">Abilities
- ~~Grapple~~
- ~~Gravity shift (Shift gravity in input direction, or maybe movement direction)~~
- ~~Random ability (at the start of each turn, you are told what ability you have for the following shot)~~
- Rocket launcher (shoot a rocket that can push the ball or interact with environment)

### <p align = "center">Golf balls

### <p align = "center">Hazards/Stage elements
- Moving platforms
	- Sliding doors
	- Windmill
- Lasers
- Turrets(shoots projectiles that push the ball, basic projectiles, explosive)
- Breakable terrain(break after being hit)

### Courses
- Tours
	- Earth(standard gravity)
	- Spaceship(closed off levels, buttons to toggle artificial gravity)
	- Asteroid Belt(zero- g, lots of obstacles)
	- Moon(low gravity)
	- Jupiter(high gravity, lots of pitfalls cause gas planet)
- Solar system(goal is the sun, orbiting planets have gravity effects)

### Unlocks
- balls: hidden spots in courses
	- Zero gravity ball: ~~finish a zero- g course under par~~
	- Square ball: 
	- Sticky ball: ~~finish a stage under par after touching a goo field~~
	- Bouncy ball: ~~score a goal on the same shot that a ball hits a bounce pad~~
- abilities
	- Random ability: unlock all other abilities

	- Reset: lose your ball to a killbox-type effect
	- Thrust: score a goal on the same shot a ball goes through a push zone
	- ~~Gravity shift: finish a stage with gravity shifting under par~~
