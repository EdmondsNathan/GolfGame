- Unlocking balls (hidden in different levels)
- Unlocking abilities (different achievements)

### Game Modes
- Survival(Lots of hazards, maybe things like rising lava, survive as many turns as possible
or move as far as possible)

### Saving

### UI
- Arrow pointed towards the goal when it is not visible on the screen
- Turn and par counter
- Ability interfaces
	- Ability name/icon
	- Availability
		- Gray out when unavailable
		- Fuel gauge for abilities like thrust

### Abilities
- ~~Grapple~~
- ~~Gravity shift (Shift gravity in input direction, or maybe movement direction)~~
- Random ability (at the start of each turn, you are told what ability you have for the following shot)

### Golf balls
- Zero Gravity
- Sticky
- Bouncy

### Hazards/Stage elements
- Mines
- Moving platforms
	- Sliding doors
	- Windmill
- Lasers
- Turrets(shoots projectiles that push the ball, basic projectiles, explosive)
- Breakable terrain(break after being hit)

### Courses
- Tours
	- Earth(standard gravity)
	- Spaceship(closed off levels, buttons to toggle artificial gravity)
	- Asteroid Belt(zero- g, lots of obstacles)
	- Moon(low gravity)
	- Jupiter(high gravity, lots of pitfalls cause gas planet)
- Solar system(goal is the sun, orbiting planets cause gravity issues)

### Unlocks
- balls: hidden spots in courses
	- Zero gravity ball: ~~finish a zero- g course under par~~
	- Square ball: 
	- Sticky ball: ~~finish a stage under par after touching a goo field~~
	- Bouncy ball: ~~score a goal on the same shot that a ball hits a bounce pad~~
- abilities

	- Boost: have a ball go over X meters/second
	- Reset: lose your ball to a killbox-type effect
	- Thrust: score a goal on the same shot a ball goes through a push zone
	- ~~Gravity shift: finish a stage with gravity shifting under par~~
