# TODO
## Menu
- Menu hides/shows locked/unlocked items

## Game
- Unlockables

## UI
- Better aim/charge preview
- Turn and par counter
- Ability

## Abilities
- Grapple
- Gravity shift (Shift gravity in input direction)
- Random ability(at the start of each turn, you are told what ability you have for the following shot)

## Golf balls
- Standard
- Zero Gravity
- Sticky
- Bouncy

## Hazards/Stage elements
- Worm hole
- Black hole
- Mines
- Hinged platforms
- Moving platforms
	- Sliding doors
	- Windmill
- Pinball paddles
- Lasers
- Turrets(shoots projectiles that push the ball)
- Goo(slows down ball)
- Breakable terrain(break after being hit)
- physics objects

## Courses
- Tours
	- Earth(standard gravity)
	- Spaceship(closed off levels, buttons to toggle artificial gravity)
	- Asteroid Belt(zero- g, lots of obstacles)
	- Moon(low gravity)
	- Jupiter(high gravity, lots of pitfalls cause gas planet)
- Solar system(goal is the sun, orbiting planets cause gravity issues)

## Unlocks
- balls: hidden spots in courses
	- zero gravity ball: ~~finish a zero- g course under par~~
	- square ball: 
	- sticky ball: ~~finish a stage under par after touching a goo field~~
	- bouncy ball: ~~score a goal on the same shot that a ball hits a bounce pad~~
- abilities
	- random ability: unlock all other abilities
	- brake: 
	- boost: 
	- reset: lose your ball to a killbox-type effect
	-thrust: score a goal on the same shot a ball goes through a push zone
	-gravity shift: finish a stage with gravity shifting under par
