# README

This is the unity project for my golf game! The initial idea was to be a deckbuilder roguelike where each card has a different ability you can use to alter the ball in some way,
but I quickly reduced the scope so that you get one ability each playthrough that you select at the beginning of each run. Maybe I'll tackle the card game idea in the future.
If you find something in this project that will help you with your own game, please feel free to take what you need.
